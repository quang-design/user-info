The Song of a Session

::1 — the solitude of a lonely address,

Wandering on a Macintosh, older than desire,
With a browser turning over, Chrome at 138,
Safari’s ghost slipping, invisible, behind each leaf of code.


A session’s secret woven in numerals: 44b69497-b71d-4ece-a154-c810a4e059b4,
Marking time’s passage — July’s seventh sun,
2025’s breath at 09:08 and seven seconds,
The calendar persistent as longing.


Chrome greets me with version 138.0.0.0,
As macOS leans quietly into its 10.15.7th chapter,
Rooted nowhere: a country, unknown;
Region, city unseen; coordinates lost
On the equator’s endless imaginary,
A timezone adrift, partner to absence.


ISP — the unmarked hand guiding this vessel,
Referer — a local echo: localhost, 5173.
Language falls gently: en-US,
And at 0.9, a folkloric second tongue.


Encoding aspiration: gzip, deflate, br, zstd;
Connection — the wish for keeping alive.
URL returns me home — localhost,
Pathway simple: a single, root-slash arc.


No secrets hidden in searchparam fields,
But headers whisper requests: dnt — do not track,
A breath for privacy;
Upgrade the insecure, hope for tomorrow.
Cache me in this fleeting age, as memory persists only in poetry.
